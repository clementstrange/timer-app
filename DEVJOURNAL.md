# Development Journal - 30 June 2025 - Deployment

CODING WINS - Timer App Deployment

Fixed async/await race condition in React timer reset function
Successfully deployed FastAPI backend to Railway with PostgreSQL database
Migrated from SQLite to PostgreSQL for production
Configured environment variables for database connection
Deployed React frontend to Vercel with proper build settings
Fixed CORS configuration for production cross-origin requests
Implemented full-stack communication between live frontend and backend
Debugged and resolved deployment issues (dependencies, build commands, directory structure)

TECHNICAL SKILLS DEVELOPED

Async/await timing and Promise handling in JavaScript
Database migration strategies (SQLite â†’ PostgreSQL)
Cloud deployment workflows (Railway + Vercel)
Environment variable configuration for production
CORS policy management for cross-origin requests
Build system troubleshooting and configuration

SHIPPED

Live, fully functional timer app at https://timer-app-q7nv.vercel.app
Production backend API at https://believable-courage-production.up.railway.app
Complete CRUD functionality working in production environment

MINDSET WIN

Pushed through multiple deployment roadblocks without giving up
Followed the "ship early, ship often" philosophy from your roadmap
Gained real experience with the full development-to-deployment cycle

# Development Journal - 28 June 2025 -Full CRUD Implementation

Attempted to vibecode the whole thing into deployment via vercel, supabase and it burned. Spent hours going back to the old commit. 

# Development Journal - 25 June 2025 -Full CRUD Implementation

 Built complete Update functionality for tasks
 Added edit state management with editingTaskId and temporary edit values
 Implemented conditional rendering for edit/display modes
 Created PUT endpoint in FastAPI for updating tasks
 Added proper form controls with text input and number spinner

Backend Enhancements

 Built PUT route /task/{task_id} for updating existing tasks
 Learned SQLAlchemy object tracking and live updates (task_to_edit.field = new_value)
 Fixed empty task list bug (return [] instead of [{null object}])
 Improved error handling and response messages

Code Quality & Organization

 Refactored messy App.tsx into organized sections with clear headers
 Extracted inline styles to named variables for reusability
 Added helpful comments for complex state management
 Cleaned up backend with proper spacing, docstrings, and function names
 Fixed inconsistent formatting and spacing throughout codebase

Technical Learning

 Mastered conditional JSX rendering patterns (condition ? editMode : displayMode)
 Learned React controlled inputs with temporary state management
 Understood SQLAlchemy ORM object tracking and commit patterns
 Practiced proper state isolation (edit values separate from display values)

Major Milestone

 Completed full CRUD operations - Create, Read, Update, Delete
 Built professional fullstack app with React + TypeScript + FastAPI + SQLite

Status: Ready for deployment or next project phase! ðŸš€
