[x] Created the localhost version before full auth integration
[x]Fixed database authentication bugs - Resolved delete button functionality by migrating from old API endpoints to Supabase client methods with proper .eq() syntax
[x]Implemented guest user localStorage system - Built complete CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) for tasks using browser localStorage with JSON serialization
[x]Added authentication state management - Integrated Supabase auth checking with React state to detect logged-in vs guest users throughout the app
[x]Created dual-mode data persistence - Implemented if/else logic in all database functions to route to localStorage for guests and Supabase for authenticated users
[x]Resolved TypeScript deployment errors - Fixed type annotations for user state and localStorage operations to successfully deploy to Vercel


Next time we're building the next stage - full supabase integration. 




# Development Journal - 15 July 2025

[x] Remove the add task button
[x] Finish does not reset the task input and does not reset the timer
[x] Start supabase auth

Supabase needs work, but hey, got the first entry done! Seems like each button now needs work, but that's alright. 

# Development Journal - 14 July 2025

[x] Remove the add task button
[x] Finish does not reset the task input and does not reset the timer
[] Start supabase auth

Need to check next time if these work properly. Did not start Supabase yet.

# Development Journal - 10 July 2025

x Fixed the annoying window stretch issue due to CSS
x Created a localhost version of the app that allows me to check the UI quicker than the production version
x Decided that I will be building the user auth next and will remove the add task button. 
x Found a new Bug. Finish does not reset the task input option and does not reset the timer!

âœ… What Was Done Today (Long Break Session!):


Mobile-responsive design - Added responsive breakpoints and separate mobile/desktop layouts with centered web frame for desktop users
Visual design overhaul - Implemented modern card-based UI with shadows, rounded corners, color-coded session types, and professional styling
Layout restructuring - Removed separate task manager pane, moved task input underneath "No task selected" text for cleaner flow
Enhanced typography - Added responsive text sizing using clamp() and improved visual hierarchy with better spacing and colors
Improved UX patterns - Task input only appears when needed, Enter key support, auto-clear input, disabled states for empty submissions
Button and interaction polish - Removed emojis from buttons (kept in headers), improved touch targets, better button grouping and styling
Desktop-specific enhancements - Created centered 600px frame with gray background to prevent timer from taking full screen width
Dynamic browser title - Added timer display in browser tab showing countdown and session type when running
Better task management - Enhanced task editing interface with better form layouts and responsive design for mobile devices
Code organization - Consolidated styles, improved component structure, and separated mobile/desktop render logic for maintainability

ðŸ“‹ Next Time TODOs:

Sound notifications - Add audio alerts when work/break sessions complete to notify users when tab isn't active
Browser notifications - Implement native browser notifications for session transitions even when page is in background
Customizable durations - Allow users to adjust work/break/long break lengths in a settings panel
Keyboard shortcuts - Add spacebar for start/pause, R for reset, Enter for task submission, etc.
Session analytics - Create daily/weekly productivity charts and time tracking summaries
Auto-start functionality - Optional setting to automatically begin next session after breaks complete
Task categories/projects - Add color-coding, tagging, or project grouping for better task organization
Data export features - Allow users to download their productivity data as CSV or generate PDF reports
Offline functionality - Implement local storage backup and sync capabilities for reliability
Performance optimizations - Add lazy loading for large task lists and optimize re-renders for better performance

COMPLETED TODAY:
âœ… Fixed major pomodoro timing bugs

Resolved race condition causing double pomo counting
Fixed break sessions not starting after work sessions
Implemented proper session transitions: work â†’ auto-break â†’ stopped work

âœ… Learned React useEffect debugging

Used console.log strategically to trace state changes
Identified dependency array issues causing multiple triggers
Fixed ref synchronization between state and refs

âœ… Improved pomodoro UX

Work sessions (25sec test) â†’ automatic break (5sec test)
