    - implement controlled components for each input
    - validate user input
    - display validation errors

- [ ] **day 12: create custom hooks**

    - extract form logic to custom hook (useForm)

    - implement useToggle hook
    - refactor components to use your custom hooks

- [ ] **day 13: start todo app project**

    - scaffold your final todo app components
    - create data model for todo items
    - implement basic layout and component structure
    - set up initial state management

- [ ] **day 14: todo app basic features**

    - implement add todo functionality
    - create todo list rendering
    - add delete todo feature
    - implement toggle completion

- [ ] **day 15: todo app styling and ux**

    - add proper css styling
    - implement empty state for no todos
    - add validation for empty inputs
    - improve focus management for form


week 4: final project (part 2) and deployment

- [ ] **day 16: implement todo filters**

    - add "all/active/completed" filters
    - implement filter state management
    - style active filter differently
    - persist filter preference

- [ ] **day 17: add local storage persistence**

    - save todos to localStorage
    - load todos from localStorage on startup
    - handle serialization edge cases
    - implement persistence error handling

    - implement validation for edits
    - improve edit mode ux

- [ ] **day 19: add finishing touches**

    - implement clear completed button
    - add todo count display
    - implement keyboard shortcuts
    - add responsive design improvements

- [ ] **day 20: deploy your project**

    - prepare app for production
    - run build process
    - deploy to vercel or netlify
    - test deployed application thoroughly


bonus challenges if you finish early:

- add due dates to todos
- implement categories or tags
- add drag and drop reordering
- implement dark/light mode toggle
- add animations for list changes

this roadmap follows a progressive approach where each day builds on the previous one, and you're constantly building something tangible. by the end of 4 weeks, you'll have a fully functional todo app and solid react fundamentals before moving on to fastapi.
